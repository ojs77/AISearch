# AISearch
Using AI Search techniques to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem.

Algorithm A is a greedy algorithm which chooses the shortest route to the next node each time.

Algorithm B is an Ant Colony optimization algorithm which spawns ants at every node and uses similar techniques an ant colony would to find food.
Ants deposit pheremones on the paths that they go on which is used to determine the routes that future ants will go on.
